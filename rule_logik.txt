Patient information: Here the basic patient information is imported
- if age < 18: go to treatment_recommendation.html --> show 'consult hematology' 
- else: go to chadsvasc.html

chadsvasc.html: Here the indication for DOAC is calculated
- answers of previous assessment should be shown for: age_group AND sex
- if score <2: go to treatment_recommendation.html --> show 'no anticoagulation based on CHADSVASC-score of 'X' points indicated
- if score >=2 and GFR != '<15': go to contraindications.html
- if score >= 2 and GFR = '<15': go to treatment_recommendation.html: show 'consult hematology'

contraindications.html: Here the absolute contraindications for DOACs are assessed
- only show checkbox 'pregnant or breastfeeding' if sex = 'F', else: 'pregnant or breastfeeding' = False and is hidden
- if derived_absolute_contraindication > 0: go to treatment_recommendation.html --> show 'Marcoumar, usage of DOAC is contraindicated'
- if derived_absolute_contraindication = 0: go to interactions.html

interactions.html: Assess whether or not drugs need further assessment and/or therapy additional to DOAC
- Aspirin and Clopidogrel derive a new variable 'derived_dual_antiplatelet_therapy', this is True when both Aspirin and Clopidogrel are True
- If 'interacting drugs' is true show on same html: 'Calculate risk factors for increased bleeding tendency due to drug-drug interaction.'
-- blend in 'HAS-BLED' Questions
-- answers of previous assessment should be shown for: age, GFR, Weight, Stroke_or_Tia
-- Uncontrolled Hypertension should be unchecked if Hypertension-variable is False
-- Calculate HASBLED, if score >= 3 then 'HASBLED_RF_Calc': True; else: False
- Calculcate derived_riskfactor_calculated with 'derived_age_RF', 'derived_GFR_RF', 'NSAID','HASBLED_RF_Calc'
- Go To treatment_recommendation.html

- if no contraindication:
-- Show 'Eliquis 2x2.5mg' if age >= 80, weight <= 60 or Krea >= 133; else: 'Eliquis 2x5mg'

-- Show 'Consult Hematology': if GFR>15 and GFR <=29
-- Show 'PPI recommendation' if derived_PPI_indication = True
